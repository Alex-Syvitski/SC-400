Study Notes --- SC-400: Administering Information Protection and Compliance in Microsoft 365

9/17/2023 - Completed the official course material modules. Added alot of diagrams and info from modules. Will be focusing on study notes for now, hopefully start exam prep week or two following.

9/16/2023 - Added Notes and Diagrams section using content pulled from microsoft learning material, may break it into a seperate document. Started reviewing some of content, despite length I may not try to pair it down as it is fairly good and easy to read /follow but I do not like any of the layout. Probably wont fix because effort is of little value.

9/13/2023 - Draft one complete. Initial formatting is complete. Will be reviewing and updating as I study the offical course material. 

9/11/2023 - Initial Study Notes generated based of Microsoft exam guide with ChatGPT. Roughly 50% complete.
