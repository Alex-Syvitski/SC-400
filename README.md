Study Notes --- SC-400: Administering Information Protection and Compliance in Microsoft 365

12/9/2023 - Extremly heavy study day and first XMas party great day. As part of all my studies I cleaned up the diagram as it is very useful and has some nice powershell examples for practical use. Added cheat sheet to its body and cleaned up spacing as much as possible.

12/9/2023 - Life comes at you fast :) Been ready for awhile but on a tight budget. Things are more freed up so I restarted the course from scratch as I became demotivated due to finances. Now I'm working I don't want to waste too much time and complete this. Practice quiz's this week put me on track to write next week. I am not using any of my previous material instead just the learn.microsoft source material. I have put together a nice cheatsheet to study everyday leading up. Will tweak with any other concepts to add. 

**Flipping through my SC-400 diagrams, its not bad to flip through but a waste to print.

10/18/2023 - My own studyings going good but have not used these notes very much. Think I will force myself to write the exam in few weeks, waiting to see if Ignite skill challenge's.

10/06/2023 - Did a couple of presentations recently. Because I could pick the topic, I choose MS Purview DLP - forcing me to get quite good at the topic. Here is my presentation material, credit to microsoft for most screenshots.

9/25/2023 - Broke diagrams and personal notes off of main study notes, add more content. Doing a second pass of Microsoft study notes. Diving deeper into SC-400 in the coming week or so.

9/17/2023 - Completed the official course material modules. Added alot of diagrams and info from modules. Will be focusing on study notes for now, hopefully start exam prep week or two following.

9/16/2023 - Added Notes and Diagrams section using content pulled from microsoft learning material, may break it into a seperate document. Started reviewing some of content, despite length I may not try to pair it down as it is fairly good and easy to read /follow but I do not like any of the layout. Probably wont fix because effort is of little value.

9/13/2023 - Draft one complete. Initial formatting is complete. Will be reviewing and updating as I study the offical course material. 

9/11/2023 - Initial Study Notes generated based of Microsoft exam guide with ChatGPT. Roughly 50% complete.
