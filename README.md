Study Notes --- SC-400: Administering Information Protection and Compliance in Microsoft 365

10/18/2023 - My own studyings going good but have not used these notes very much. Think I will force myself to write the exam in few weeks, waiting to see if Ignite skill challenge's.

10/06/2023 - Did a couple of presentations recently. Because I could pick the topic, I choose MS Purview DLP - forcing me to get quite good at the topic. Here is my presentation material, credit to microsoft for most screenshots.

9/25/2023 - Broke diagrams and personal notes off of main study notes, add more content. Doing a second pass of Microsoft study notes. Diving deeper into SC-400 in the coming week or so.

9/17/2023 - Completed the official course material modules. Added alot of diagrams and info from modules. Will be focusing on study notes for now, hopefully start exam prep week or two following.

9/16/2023 - Added Notes and Diagrams section using content pulled from microsoft learning material, may break it into a seperate document. Started reviewing some of content, despite length I may not try to pair it down as it is fairly good and easy to read /follow but I do not like any of the layout. Probably wont fix because effort is of little value.

9/13/2023 - Draft one complete. Initial formatting is complete. Will be reviewing and updating as I study the offical course material. 

9/11/2023 - Initial Study Notes generated based of Microsoft exam guide with ChatGPT. Roughly 50% complete.
